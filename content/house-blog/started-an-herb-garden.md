title: Started an Herb Garden
---
I started an herb garden!! To Celebrate earth day I went and picked up a bunch of seeds and planted thyme, rosemary, oregano, marjoram, lavender, and sage in an old water trough that was left at the house. Inside I planted basil and cilantro, and I even planted some decorative grass in an old planter that was laying around.

Should be a week or two before they start to sprout!
